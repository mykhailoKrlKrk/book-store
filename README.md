| Feature                           | Usage                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spring Boot Security and JWT Token | Enable secure user authentication and data protection.                      |
| Spring Boot Data JPA                | This feature enables users to interact with the database and perform various operations. It provides a range of functionalities to manipulate and manage the data stored in the database. creation, updating, and removal.        |
| Liquibase          | Effectively manage database structure with generic scripts that can be adapted to different types of databases.  |
| Docker                  | A containerization platform simplifies deployment, improves portability, and eases management of Spring Boot applications and their dependencies by providing an isolated runtime environment for applications. |
| Integrational tests usning testcontainers                    | With Test containers, tests run against a real database instance, ensuring the validity of SQL queries and transactions.                 |
| Hibernate          | An object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database interaction in Spring Boot applications. It automates the mapping of Java classes to database tables, streamlining data persistence and retrieval operations.                                            |
| Mapstruct and Lombok              |Mapstruct and Lombok are two useful tools that can simplify the process of mapping objects between Java beans. By generating mapping code and providing annotations for common methods like getters, setters, and constructors, these tools can help to reduce boilerplate code and make Java code more concise and readable. When used together in Spring Boot applications, they can enhance code maintainability and improve developer productivity.
